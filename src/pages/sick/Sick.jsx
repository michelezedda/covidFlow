              <p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Stay home and away from others until you have been
                    fever-free without the use of fever reducing medication for
                    24 hours, and other symptoms are improving.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Wear a well-fitting mask in shared spaces and around others
                    for 10 days after you start feeling sick.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Get tested for COVID-19. If you are high risk for getting
                    very sick, talk to your provider about testing for other
                    respiratory viruses. If you test positive, follow COVID-19
                    Community Guidelines. Regardless of your test results, you
                    should stay home until symptoms improve, wear a mask around
                    others, and talk to your doctor about treatment options.

              <h2>REDUCING RISK OF RESPIRATORY ILLNESS:</h2>
              <p>
                There are certain places where respiratory viruses spread more
                easily:
                <ul>
                  <li>Closed spaces with poor air flow</li>
                  <li>Crowded places</li>
                  <li>
                    Close contact settings especially where people close by are
                    talking, singing, coughing, shouting, sneezing, or breathing
                    heavily
                  </li>
                </ul>
                To protect yourself and others from respiratory illness, follow
                these best practices:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Everyone 6 months and older should get the updated COVID-19
                    and flu vaccines.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Stay home when sick. If you have any symptoms of respiratory
                    illness, stay away from others until you feel better.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Test for COVID-19 if: You are sick with cough, cold, flu, or
                    COVID-19 symptoms, OR Have been exposed, especially if you
                    or someone you have contact with are at high risk for severe
                    disease. Consider testing for flu in addition to COVID-19 if
                    you are at high risk of severe illness. If you test positive
                    for COVID-19, follow Community Guidelines.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Ask about medicine to treat flu or COVID-19 as soon as you
                    start feeling sick. Treatment can prevent you from getting
                    very sick but should be started soon after your symptoms
                    begin. Talk to your doctor or call the Public Health Call
                    Center at 1-833-540-0473.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Wear a mask that fits and filters well. You should mask when
                    you feel sick, have been exposed to someone who is sick, or
                    when community risk is higher.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Improve ventilation (air flow). Open windows and doors, use
                    fans and portable air cleaners, run heating and air, and
                    upgrade filters. When possible, choose outdoor spaces for
                    group activities. For more information, visit the CDC’s
                    webpage Improving Ventilation in Your Home.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Practice good everyday hygiene, like washing your hands and
                    covering your coughs and sneezes. Washing your hands is one
                    of the best ways to avoid getting sick and spreading germs
                    that cause respiratory illnesses and diarrhea.

              <h2>IMMUNIZATIONS</h2>
              <p>
                Getting vaccinated is the best way to prevent severe illness.
                Safe, updated immunizations are available for all three
                respiratory virus diseases.
                <br />
                COVID-19 vaccines are safe and effective. Everyone 6 months and
                older should get a 2023-2024 updated COVID-19 vaccine
                (Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, or Novavax).
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Everyone 5 years and older should get 1 dose of an updated
                    COVID-19 vaccine.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Children 6 month to 4 years need at least 1 dose of an
                    updated COVID-19 vaccine. They may require additional
                    vaccine doses depending on whether or not they have
                    previously been vaccinated against COVID-19.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    People who are immunocompromised may receive additional
                    updated COVID-19 vaccine doses.

              <h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
              <p>
                COVID-19, flu, and RSV are some of the diseases caused by
                viruses that have very similar symptoms. Illness can be mild to
                severe, and some people may have no symptoms. Those who do get
                sick may experience any of the following:
                <ul>
                  <li>Fever/chills</li>
                  <li>Cough</li>
                  <li>Sore throat</li>
                  <li>Runny nose or stuffy nose</li>
                  <li>Difficulty Breathing</li>
                  <li>Body aches</li>
                </ul>
                Other symptoms are possible with each of these infections. RSV
                is more likely to cause bronchiolitis (inflammation of small
                airways in the lungs) in children than other viruses. Although
                certain symptoms can be more common with one virus than another,
                it is hard to tell which infection someone has based on symptoms
                alone.
                <br />
                <br />
                Some people may experience symptoms for weeks, which could be
                long COVID-19 or long flu.
                <br />
                <br />
                Anyone who has difficulty breathing or symptoms that worsen
                should seek immediate medical care.
              </p>
              <h2>WHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL CARE</h2>
              <p>
                For treatments, talk to your healthcare provider. Call 2-1-1 to
                find a nearby provider if it is not an emergency and you do not
                have a provider. People with high-risk health conditions should
                seek medical attention even with mild symptoms.
                <br />
                In general, most minor respiratory virus infections improve with
                simple steps (getting plenty of rest, drinking enough fluids,
                eating well). Symptoms such as fever and pain can be managed
                with over-the-counter medications such as acetaminophen or
                ibuprofen (never give aspirin to children.) Antibiotics do not
                help with diseases caused by viruses. Antiviral medications are
                available for certain individuals with flu and COVID-19. These
                medications should be started soon as symptoms begin. Currently
                there are no specific antiviral medications for RSV.
                <br />
                If symptoms do not get better after a week, or if your symptoms
                get worse after starting to improve, talk to a healthcare
                provider or go to urgent care.
                <br />
                If symptoms get worse and are urgent, seek emergency medical
                care.
                <br />
                Many adults and some children qualify for treatment if they have
                symptoms of COVID-19 AND either they test positive for COVID-19
                OR a doctor recommends treatment. Medication should be started
                within 5-7 days of first symptoms. If you don’t have a provider,
                LA County Department of Public Health can assist with COVID-19
                treatment.
